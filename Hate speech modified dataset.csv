"In 2022, I experienced an uncomfortable incident at IUB in an elevator. There were only four of us inside – me another indigenous girl, a woman, and another guy. Out of nowhere, the woman made a comment clearly mocking where I’m from, suggesting that people like us live in Bandarban and implying we’re somehow less knowledgeable or 'modern.' Her comment felt dismissive and offensive.

What made it worse was that the guy in the elevator just laughed along instead of acknowledging how hurtful her remark was. I felt isolated and frustrated, especially since this stereotyping and judgment were the last things I expected to encounter in a diverse environment like IUB.",Insensitive,"It's important to approach all people with kindness, respect, and dignity, regardless of their background or identity. The concept of humiliating anyone, including an Indigenous girl, is harmful and goes against the principles of empathy and understanding.

Humiliation involves causing someone to feel degraded, shamed, or belittled. This can have lasting emotional, mental, and even physical consequences on the person who experiences it. Historically, Indigenous peoples have faced systemic oppression, marginalization, and discrimination. Engaging in actions that humiliate or demean any group or individual only perpetuates these harmful dynamics.

Instead of focusing on negative or harmful behavior, we should aim to learn from and support Indigenous cultures, histories, and people in a way that honors their experiences and contributions."
"We are secretly maping to make a new separated country,traitor, out comer. even an  iub meme page shared a random flag  and claimed that we already made our flag and we want separate country.",Offensive,"This statement reflects a situation where misinformation or accusations about a group's intentions are spreading, potentially stoking division. Claims of ""secretly mapping to make a new separated country"" and terms like ""traitor"" and ""outcomer"" indicate a narrative designed to frame the group as disloyal or threatening to the unity of a larger community. Such rhetoric is often used to marginalize or scapegoat specific groups, exploiting existing tensions for social, political, or ideological purposes.

The mention of an IUB meme page sharing a ""random flag"" adds a layer of online dynamics to the issue. Social media platforms, particularly informal spaces like meme pages, can amplify unverified claims and stir controversy. If a random flag was falsely associated with plans for secession, it could further entrench misunderstandings and fuel hostility. This highlights the importance of critical engagement with online content and responsible behavior by influential pages to prevent the escalation of baseless allegations."
"People often have misconceptions about us and comment really hurtful things about us and  and say disgusting things . If we try to correct them, they become defensive. But never try to understand real facts. people believe rumors and spread false rumors about us. We all experience this in recent incidents this year(2024).



",Offensive,"This statement highlights the challenges faced by groups or individuals subjected to widespread misconceptions and prejudice. The mention of ""hurtful"" and ""disgusting"" comments indicates a pattern of dehumanization and stereotyping, likely driven by ignorance or bias. When attempts are made to correct these false perceptions, the defensive reactions from others reflect a psychological phenomenon where people resist admitting they are wrong, often due to ego or fear of change. This resistance prevents constructive dialogue and perpetuates misunderstanding, making it harder to dismantle stereotypes.

The situation is further exacerbated by the tendency of people to believe and spread rumors without verifying facts, as noted in the recent incidents of 2024. Rumors often gain traction in environments where misinformation is widespread, leading to social exclusion and emotional distress for the affected group. This underscores the need for broader public education, critical thinking, and a cultural shift toward empathy and open-mindedness in addressing these issues."
"One of the biggest things Bengalis do is spread rumors, and it's their custom to blame their brothers.","Insensitive




","This statement originally pointed to two separate social problems. First, ""spreading rumors"" is a widely discussed cultural tendency that creates confusion, panic and misconception in society. One of the reasons for the rapid spread of rumors is the lack of information and emotional reactions. Although it is a human weakness, it can lead to negative generalization when mentioned in a particular group or population."
"I’m currently pursuing undergraduate degree at a well known university. I’ve always been a privileged kid while growing up. Got better education,better environment. Despite all of that, i get to hear stuffs like, “মামা পাহাড়ে যামু, পাহাড়ি মাল খামু। কি ম্যানেজ করে দিতে পারবি না?” What it meant is the lustful intentional feelings towards hill/indigenous women and the local rice wine as well, depending on the individual. And I’ve always been asked of ~ মামা একটা পাহাড়ি মেয়ে ঠিক করে দে। 
Another thing is being addressed by the title name/surname like ~ ""Hey Chakma/marma come here"", This is sometimes offending, to me at least. 
Upojati/chung-chan is also used often.


","Insensitive




","The experience highlights the persistent stereotyping and objectification faced by indigenous communities, even among those who have had access to privilege and education. Phrases like “মামা পাহাড়ে যামু, পাহাড়ি মাল খামু” or requests for “fixing” an indigenous girl reflect a deeply rooted culture of dehumanization and fetishization. These remarks reduce indigenous women to mere objects of desire, ignoring their individuality and dignity, and perpetuate harmful narratives that contribute to systemic marginalization.

Additionally, being addressed by your title or surname, such as “চাকমা” or “মারমা,” rather than your name, or being called terms like “উপজাতি” or “চুঙ-চাং,” can feel othering and dismissive. It reinforces a sense of exclusion by prioritizing ethnicity over individuality and implies a lack of belonging in mainstream spaces. Such behavior underscores the need for greater cultural sensitivity and education about respecting ethnic diversity, fostering an environment where everyone is valued beyond stereotypes."
"Due to oppresive circumstances in cht hill tracts recently what i mostly faced on social media is mocking and demeaning our language and food habbit.Besides because of widely spreading propaganda by huge number of social media vloggers without knowing the proper knowledge and information about history of our ethnicity group they keep labelling us as rebels and isolationists which affects the whole nation mostly.


","Insensitive




","The comment reflects the challenges faced by indigenous communities in the Chittagong Hill Tracts, particularly regarding cultural discrimination and misinformation on social media. Mockery of language and food habits exemplifies a lack of respect for cultural diversity, fostering alienation. Furthermore, the widespread dissemination of propaganda by social media influencers, often uninformed about the historical and cultural contexts of these ethnic groups, perpetuates harmful stereotypes such as labeling them as ""rebels"" or ""isolationists."" This not only marginalizes these communities but also exacerbates societal divisions, undermining efforts for national unity and coexistence. Addressing these issues requires promoting accurate representation, education, and respect for cultural heritage."
"There are many people in our society who degrade us in various ways. Like they address us as ""chung chang"" ""tribe"" etc. At present one thing is seen that a section is threatening our tribal women with various forms of sexual harassment including rape threats. 



",Offensive,"This comment underscores the persistent discrimination faced by indigenous communities, particularly through derogatory language and stereotypes. Terms like ""chung chang"" or ""tribe"" are often used in a dismissive and dehumanizing manner, reducing individuals to caricatures of their ethnicity and denying their individuality. Such labels reflect a broader societal issue of ignorance and prejudice, which marginalizes these groups and perpetuates a culture of exclusion and disrespect.

The targeting of tribal women with threats of sexual harassment, including rape threats, is a grave concern. These actions are not only a violation of individual dignity and safety but also a tactic to intimidate and silence entire communities. Gender-based violence, especially when directed at marginalized groups, highlights the intersection of ethnic and gender oppression. Addressing this requires a multifaceted approach, including legal reforms, enforcement of existing laws, and widespread social awareness to challenge both ethnic and gender-based discrimination."
"1.In our hill tribes the main ingredient we use in our food is 'sidol' in english it is called shrimp paste which is made by several small smashed fish.It has a bit strong smell i agree though.It is typically made in coastal areas mainly with seafood.In our country its main production area is coxbazar i guess or other sea area.There are other sources also i dont have that much idea right now
2.if i have to talk about our food habbit i would say it has come from our ancestors.
3.in our religion there are no restrictions regarding our dietry.



","Insensitive




","
The food habits of the hill tribes are deeply rooted in ancestral traditions and cultural practices, reflecting a unique culinary heritage. A staple ingredient in their cuisine is sidol or shrimp paste, made from small, fermented fish. While it has a strong smell, it is a cherished flavor enhancer and an integral part of their dishes. Shrimp paste is also common in coastal cuisines worldwide and is primarily produced in coastal areas like Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, though it may be sourced from other regions as well. This ingredient highlights the community’s connection to nature and its sustainable use of local resources.

Dietary practices among the hill tribes are not only shaped by cultural inheritance but also guided by religious beliefs. Restrictions and guidelines related to food underscore the interplay between spirituality and daily life, ensuring that dietary choices align with religious values. These practices, handed down through generations, reflect a harmonious blend of tradition, environment, and faith, offering a rich and diverse culinary identity that deserves recognition and respect."

","Insensitive




","When individuals from the Chittagong Hill Tracts step outside their region for education or other pursuits, they often encounter intrusive and insensitive questions from peers, such as whether they eat snakes, frogs, or pork. While these inquiries may sometimes stem from curiosity, they often carry an undertone of mockery, making the recipients feel awkward and uncomfortable. Such questions not only highlight a lack of cultural sensitivity but also perpetuate stereotypes about dietary practices, reducing a diverse cultural heritage to a few clichés.

Food habits are inherently personal and shaped by cultural, historical, and environmental factors. It is natural for dietary preferences to differ across ethnicities, reflecting the diversity of human experiences. While some ancestors of hill tribes may have consumed unconventional foods, and some individuals continue these traditions, mocking such practices disregards the value of cultural diversity. Respect for others' food choices fosters inclusivity and mutual understanding, underscoring the importance of viewing culinary differences with curiosity rather than judgment."
"i think what written in buddhism is killing any living being is a great sin...he did not emphasised specially on any food habbit




","Insensitive




","
Your understanding aligns with a core principle of Buddhism: the emphasis on compassion and non-violence, including the belief that killing any living being is a great sin. This foundational teaching promotes kindness and respect for all life forms, guiding many followers in their ethical and moral decisions.

However, as you correctly pointed out, the Buddha did not lay down specific dietary restrictions or emphasize particular food habits. Instead, his teachings focused on mindfulness and moderation in all aspects of life, including eating. Dietary choices are often shaped by regional customs, availability of resources, and cultural interpretations of Buddhist principles. This allows for diversity in food habits among Buddhist communities while maintaining the essence of the teachings—non-violence, compassion, and mindful living."
"its basically a contradictory content.




",Offensive,"The phrase ""it's basically a contradictory content"" points to an apparent inconsistency or conflict within the subject being discussed. In contexts like religion or philosophy, contradictions may arise from differing interpretations or from the evolution of practices over time. For example, if a teaching emphasizes non-violence yet does not explicitly prescribe dietary habits, individuals might interpret this differently, leading to perceived contradictions in practice.

Such contradictions are not uncommon when broad principles are applied to diverse cultural or historical contexts. They often reflect the complexity of balancing universal values with individual or community practices. Rather than invalidating the core message, these contradictions can prompt deeper reflection and dialogue to better understand the nuances involved."
"Back in 2018, during our university admission coaching, my best friend and I had an unsettling experience on our very first day in class. The tutor, who was a Bangla instructor, asked us to stand up and questioned whether we could speak Bangla. He explained that he would need to give extra attention if we couldn’t, mentioning that the previous year, a Chakma girl in his class struggled to understand Bangla.

Despite assuring him that we both spoke and understood Bangla fluently, he seemed reluctant to believe us. His attitude made us feel singled out, as though we were different and didn’t truly belong. It was disheartening to be judged based on assumptions rather than being treated like everyone else.

",Offensive,"
This account reflects the subtle but impactful ways in which biases and assumptions can create feelings of exclusion for minority groups. The tutor's actions—singling out the students based on their ethnicity and questioning their ability to speak Bangla—demonstrate how preconceived notions can overshadow individual realities. While the intent may have been to offer support, the approach was rooted in stereotypes rather than understanding, leaving the students feeling alienated rather than included.

The reluctance to believe their assurance of fluency further emphasized the assumption that their ethnic background inherently made them less capable. Such experiences, especially in academic settings, undermine a sense of belonging and equal treatment, which are vital for fostering a positive learning environment. This highlights the need for greater awareness and sensitivity in interactions, particularly for educators, to ensure all students are treated with respect and without bias."

",Offensive,"
In this passage, the speaker is questioning the praise or admiration given to the Chakma people, particularly when it comes to their perceived goodness or worth. They argue that if the Chakma were truly so good, they should be able to thrive in more challenging areas like Sajek, Rangamati, or Khagrachhari—remote and difficult-to-access places in Bangladesh. The speaker questions the necessity of any special ""defense protocols"" for these regions, implying that if the Chakma were truly as positive as claimed, these areas would not need such considerations. The criticism seems to stem from a belief that the Chakma people are being over-idealized or unfairly glorified, especially in the context of their role in the country.

The speaker continues by dismissing the idea that the Chakma people have ever been particularly good, based on their own experiences. They mention their father, who lived in Rangamati for 15 years, and claim that they personally heard negative things about the Chakma from him. The use of ""chakmara kokhono valo chilo na"" (""the Chakma were never good"") reinforces the speaker’s skepticism toward the Chakma people, suggesting that their reputation is unwarranted and that the speaker’s experiences contradict the positive narratives surrounding them. This statement conveys a personal, critical perspective based on their father’s accounts and the speaker’s own views on the situation."
"Humiliate tribe female - ""Free sexual relations""



",Insensitive,"
It's important to approach sensitive topics like gender, culture, and sexuality with respect and understanding. The phrase you mentioned seems to convey a harmful stereotype or inappropriate generalization about a specific group of people. Historically, such language can perpetuate harmful attitudes toward marginalized communities and their cultural practices. It's crucial to recognize that every culture and community has its own values, traditions, and norms, and these should be approached with empathy and care, avoiding objectification or dehumanization. Using derogatory language or making generalizations about individuals based on their ethnicity or gender undermines the dignity and respect that all people deserve. Promoting healthy, respectful conversations about different cultures is essential in fostering understanding and mutual respect."
"The Paharis should be killed, only those who are Bangladeshi will remain in the country...",Offensive,"Such comments are extremely disgusting and inhuman. It is not just discriminatory, but it is a criminal and extreme violation of human rights. If you look at any such comment on social media, report it and contact the law enforcement agency if needed.

In addition, it is important to promote education in society and to raise human values to raise awareness against such mentality. Sympathy, tolerance and brotherhood are the key to peace in the society.

"""Why should there be an army in the mountains? If possible, let them keep it like that on the plains forever.""",Insensitive,"The phrase is raising a question about the permanent presence of the army in the hilly region, which is a reflection of security, rights, and equality among the local people. Although there is a conflict situation in the mountainous areas, there are many questions about the role of the army after the peace agreement. It indicates a kind of inequality, which creates a feeling of discrimination for the hill population.

This statement implies that if the army is permanently normal in the hills, the same rules should apply to the flat area. It claims to ensure the same policies and equality for all regions of the country. The discriminatory system in the hilly and flat areas can be contrary to democratic values.

Finally, the statement indicates the need for transparency and balance in the country's internal governance system. It means that the main responsibility of the state is to ensure human rights, self -realization and normal living of the local people. Therefore, this question should be solved by applying "
"""Someone: Save the mountains, save the country!!
Tribe: Agree..
Someone: I'm talking about saving the mountains from your hands.""",Offensive,"This dialogue expresses the prevailing misconception or satirical view of the location of the local population in the hilly region and their role. In the first place, the slogan ""Save Hills, Save the Country"" can be a symbol of awareness about environmental conservation or development of hilly regions. However, the comment of a person in the last part gives a diagonal indication that the main source of the mountain problem is the local population, which is obviously distinctive and abusive.

Such remarks are an attempt to blame the local population, not to solve the real problems of the Hill region. It is a reflection of the hatred or a non -communal attitude towards the hill people, which hinder the solution of the true problem. In fact, the role of the local people is important in protecting the hills and the way of solving them is to cooperate and respectful relationships with them."
"""Khagrachari

Here the ""tribal armed terrorists"" have been blamed for the murder of the teacher of Khagrachari Technical College and the vandalism of the property. Such statements usually represent the event simplified, which can create the risk of spreading hatred for dissent.

If the complaint is true, it is definitely blasphemous and it is important to confirm the punishment of the culprits under the law. However, using the phrase ""tribal armed terrorist"" may seem like an attempt to identify a group of people together as criminals. It creates division among various ethnic groups living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and increases communal tension.

Therefore, it is important to have a neutral investigation, proper information, and provocative statements in such events. To solve the problem, it is necessary to create a coordination and confidence environment between the local population and the administration, so that it is possible to avoid violence and reach a peaceful solution."

"""I still remember Holey Artisan attack.

",Offensive,"The statement appears to reference the Holey Artisan Bakery attack, a tragic terrorist event that took place in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on July 1, 2016. Armed militants took control of the bakery, killing 22 people, mostly foreigners, in a violent assault. The attack was later claimed by an Islamic extremist group, and it deeply shocked the international community. In the context of the statement, ""I still remember Holey Artisan attack,"" the speaker may be recalling the emotional impact and the widespread fear that followed the tragedy, particularly in relation to the safety of those living or working in urban centers. The incident raised concerns about extremism, security, and the vulnerability of public spaces to such violent acts.

The second part of the statement, ""glad I never aimed for private universities,"" might be reflecting a sentiment tied to concerns over the safety and security within private institutions, particularly in Bangladesh and similar regions. The Holey Artisan attack, which occurred in a popular area frequented by expatriates and foreigners, led some to question the security measures in place at high-profile private locations. The speaker might be expressing a belief that private universities or certain sectors of society may be more prone to extremist targeting due to their international ties or perceived status. In this sense, the statement could reflect a personal sense of relief or a choice to avoid such risks by not pursuing a career or education at a private institution."
"""Every hill girl needs a Bengali child. Now, I will tell my Bengali brothers to catch every hill girl, rape her and make her pregnant.""",Offensive,"The statement reflects a highly inflammatory and hateful expression of violence and ethnic superiority. It calls for the sexual violence of indigenous women and depicts a disturbing attempt to erase or subjugate a marginalized community through force. The speaker's rhetoric targets the ""hill women"" (likely referring to indigenous women in the hill regions of Bangladesh) and calls for them to bear children, specifically to produce ""Bengali"" offspring. This reflects a form of ethnonationalism that seeks to assert dominance over indigenous communities by reducing them to objects for reproduction, often linked with historical narratives of assimilation, oppression, and violence.

Such statements perpetuate harmful stereotypes, dehumanizing rhetoric, and discriminatory views against indigenous people. They contribute to a culture of hate, inciting violence and fostering division between ethnic groups. It is a direct attack on the autonomy, dignity, and rights of indigenous women, reinforcing the historical marginalization they face. Experts would emphasize that this kind of speech is not only morally reprehensible but also legally punishable in many societies for incitement to violence and hate speech. It highlights the critical importance of promoting inclusivity, respect for diversity, and the protection of all communities, especially vulnerable groups, from harm and exploitation."

",Insensitive,"The statement seems to be referencing the ongoing political and ethnic tensions in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh, a region with a significant indigenous population, particularly the Chakma people. The speaker is expressing concerns about the activities of the United People's Democratic Front (UPDF), an insurgent group in the region, and its efforts to push for autonomy or independence for the three hill districts of Bangladesh—Rangamati, Khagrachari, and Bandarban. The speaker suggests that UPDF is mobilizing indigenous students and using them as a front for its political and military objectives, calling for the independence of the CHT, and potentially leading to violent conflict in the region.

Furthermore, the statement claims that UPDF has formed an alliance with the JSS (Jana Samhati Samiti), another group that has historically advocated for the rights and autonomy of the indigenous people in CHT. According to the speaker, these groups are said to be preparing for a confrontation with the Bangladeshi military. The mention of AK-47s and sniper rifles being smuggled through the border into the area from India suggests a growing militarization of the insurgency, implying that these groups are receiving arms to wage an armed struggle. This could be an indication of escalating violence in the region, raising concerns about the security situation, the potential for further instability, and the challenges facing the Bangladeshi government in managing the ethnic and political complexities of the CHT."
"""Those who are demanding the withdrawal of the army from the mountains, you don't even know that you don't know much!""",Insensitive,"The statement  reflects a sentiment of frustration and a critique directed at individuals or groups advocating for the withdrawal of the military presence in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) of Bangladesh, an ethnically diverse region that includes indigenous communities.

The speaker appears to be suggesting that those calling for the army's removal lack a full understanding of the complexities of the situation. This could be referencing the historical and ongoing tensions between the Bangladeshi state and the indigenous populations, particularly the Chakma and other ethnic groups, who have long sought greater autonomy and rights. The military has had a significant presence in the region for decades, largely due to security concerns arising from insurgencies and the demand for greater autonomy by indigenous groups. The statement implies that while some may advocate for a military withdrawal, they may not be aware of the underlying security, political, and historical factors that justify the army's continued presence in the region, such as the protection of state interests or maintaining peace amidst ethnic tensions and armed conflict. Essentially, it suggests that there is a lack of awareness or understanding of the broader situation among those advocating for such a change."
"As long as you tribals do not identify as Bengalis, the cyber harassment will continue.



",Offensive,"The statement reflects a concerning attitude of cultural dominance and discrimination. It suggests that individuals who identify as ""Upajati"" (a term often used derogatorily for indigenous or ethnic minority groups in Bangladesh) must conform to the majority identity of being ""Bengali"" to avoid cyber abuse. This is not only a direct violation of human rights but also undermines the principle of cultural diversity and freedom of self-identification. It perpetuates a mindset where minority identities are erased, reinforcing the dominance of the majority and pressuring marginalized groups to assimilate.

Such rhetoric also highlights the growing issue of online hate speech targeting minority communities. It underscores the importance of raising awareness about respecting ethnic and cultural diversity, enforcing laws against cyberbullying, and promoting inclusivity. Ensuring safe digital spaces for everyone requires collective action—educating individuals, challenging harmful mindsets, and holding perpetrators accountable for discriminatory behavior."
"popular food of Chang-Chung people




",Insensitive,"The phrase ""popular food of Chang-Chung people"" is often used mockingly to stereotype and belittle individuals from ethnic minority or East Asian communities. The term ""চ্যাং চুং"" itself is derogatory, mimicking names or sounds perceived to represent those communities, reducing their identity to a caricature. Such language not only dehumanizes but also reinforces prejudices, perpetuating a lack of understanding and respect for cultural diversity.

This kind of stereotype reflects broader societal issues, such as xenophobia and ethnocentrism, where cultural practices—like food choices—are ridiculed instead of being appreciated as a part of human diversity. Addressing this requires educating people about the value of cultural inclusivity and respect. Encouraging dialogue and understanding about minority identities and traditions can counter these harmful narratives and help create a more empathetic and accepting society."

The sovereignty of the country comes first. Do not let it become an independent Jumland. Let Bangladesh remain one. The mountains are mine, the plains are mine, I am Bangladeshi.""",Offensive,"
This statement reflects a blend of nationalistic sentiment, skepticism, and prejudice toward the indigenous communities of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) and their concerns. Below is a breakdown of its main themes and implications:

Accusations and Generalizations: The speaker begins by accusing indigenous groups of involvement in ""terrorist activities"" and attempting to portray themselves as victims when confronted. This framing dismisses the legitimate grievances of CHT communities, such as land rights, cultural preservation, and allegations of military abuses. By questioning their historical contributions to Bangladesh's Liberation War and implying that they have no rightful claim to the hills, the statement marginalizes their identity and deep-rooted connection to the land.

Nationalism and Sovereignty Concerns: The argument asserts that the CHT belongs to all Bangladeshis, implying that indigenous people have no special claim to the land. It highlights a fear that reducing military presence (""সেনা হটাও"") might lead to foreign influence, specifically from China or others, threatening Bangladesh's sovereignty. This perspective conflates demands for autonomy or indigenous rights with secessionist movements, undermining their efforts to seek"
"""If the forests of the hills of the Chittagong Hill Tracts are cleared and cultivated in a planned manner like Sylhet, the country and the nation will benefit. Food products can be exported abroad to meet the country's needs. The tribal savages know nothing but jumma cultivation.""",Offensive,"
The statement reflects a dismissive and exploitative perspective on the indigenous communities of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) and their traditional ways of life. By suggesting that the forests in the CHT be cleared for ""planned agriculture"" like in Sylhet, it disregards the ecological balance of the region and the cultural practices of the indigenous people. The remark reduces their traditional practice of jhum cultivation (shifting agriculture) to a sign of ignorance, failing to recognize it as a sustainable and culturally significant method suited to the region's geography and climate.

Such rhetoric reflects a lack of understanding of indigenous rights and environmental sustainability. Large-scale agricultural projects could lead to deforestation, loss of biodiversity, and the displacement of indigenous communities. Instead of imposing changes, a more inclusive approach would involve respecting the knowledge and practices of indigenous people, exploring sustainable development options, and ensuring their participation in decision-making. This would balance economic growth with ecological preservation and the rights of local communities."
"""When I say, ""Ami upojati cdi"" 
The upojati I meant -"" 





",Insensitive,"The statement appears to highlight a common linguistic or social issue related to the term upajati, which is often used in Bangladesh to refer to indigenous or tribal communities. The speaker may be attempting to clarify their intent or reclaim the term, which has historically been used in both neutral and derogatory ways. Below is an explanation:

Clarifying Identity: By saying, “Ami upojati cdi,” the speaker is asserting their identity while acknowledging how the term ""upajati"" has been used. The following clarification (""The upojati I meant -"") likely serves to distinguish their understanding of the term from any negative connotations, possibly aiming to redefine or take ownership of it in a positive or accurate manner.

Contextual Significance: This phrase may also reflect a deeper conversation about identity and labels. Many indigenous communities in Bangladesh reject the term ""upajati"" because it translates to ""sub-nation"" or ""subordinate ethnicity,"" which undermines their cultural and social status. Instead, terms like ""adibashi"" (adibashi, meaning indigenous people) are preferred for their accuracy and respectfulness. The speaker might be using this statement to challenge societal perceptions or reclaim their cultural identity in their own terms."

",Insensitive,"
The statement can be seen as a rhetorical or symbolic expression of defiance, frustration, or provocation. It could represent a declaration of autonomy or independence, often made in response to perceived oppression, marginalization, or denial of rights. In the context of the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), such statements may stem from long-standing grievances of indigenous communities over issues like land rights, cultural preservation, and military presence. However, the phrase can also be used sarcastically by critics to ridicule or exaggerate the demands of these communities, framing them as separatist movements even when the actual goals are for greater autonomy or recognition within the framework of the state.

At a deeper level, this kind of language highlights the tension between marginalized communities and the dominant groups or state authorities. For indigenous people, it can serve as a call to attention for unresolved issues, while for opponents, it may reflect fears of national disunity. The use of such rhetoric emphasizes the need for inclusive dialogue, respectful acknowledgment of indigenous rights, and addressing historical injustices to avoid escalating conflicts and promote national harmony. Instead of viewing autonomy demands as threats, efforts should be made to integrate cultural diversity into the nation’s identity while ensuring equity for all citizens. "

Such statements create division in society and spread hatred, which is contrary to peaceful coexistence. Indigenous peoples like the Chakma community are part of Bangladesh and it is the responsibility of the state and society to protect their cultural, social and human rights.

Such statements not only threaten a community, but also threaten the stability and unity of society. Raising public awareness, education and taking strict legal action are very important to stop hate speech and propaganda of violence. Peaceful coexistence is not possible without developing an attitude of respect and cooperation towards each other. Everyone must come forward to resist such statements and build a culture of love and compassion instead of hatred."
"""I'm not telling you to wait a few minutes.
The Eid rain has made things worse.
I'm going to check Kafi.""",Insensitive,"This sentence is written in derogatory and sarcastic language, which is used against indigenous or minority ethnic groups. In particular, the word ""tribal"" and the way the sentence is used seem to mock their dress, culture, or pronunciation. This is clearly a hate speech, which shows disrespect for ethnic or cultural diversity. The use of such language is not only insulting, but it also creates an environment for discrimination and hatred in society.

Such statements are an example of insulting ethnic minorities and disregarding their cultural identity. It is not only degrading to one group, but also destroys unity and harmony in a diverse society as a whole. Education and raising public awareness are essential to counter hate speech. Respecting cultural and ethnic diversity and giving equal rights with dignity to each community is very important for building a healthy and just society."
"""The sub-genre has given us our name, and now we are fleeing from the cave.""",Insensitive,"The sentence (meaning: ""The tribe filed a case, in my name, now I am a fugitive in the Alutila cave"") seems to be said in a humorous or satirical manner. Through this, the narrator may have wanted to make the situation humorous by presenting himself as a ""fugitive"", but the manner and context in which the word ""tribe"" is used in the sentence suggests that it could be used to belittle the indigenous community. It conveys a dismissive view of the indigenous population, which is insensitive and irresponsible.

Such language encourages social division and cultural disdain. It is important to show respect for indigenous or minority ethnic groups and avoid derogatory or derogatory comments about them. To stop such statements, it is necessary to raise awareness and develop a culture of equal respect for all. In addition, the feelings of the community that may be affected by such derogatory comments should be taken into account."
"""Never spoke a word during the massacre ekhon 
ashche eshob silly issues niye dorod dekhaite. 
Egula upore uthe niche namar jonno-""





",Insensitive,"
This statement reflects frustration over perceived hypocrisy or misplaced priorities in discussions surrounding serious issues. The first part, ""Never spoke a word during the massacre,"" suggests that during a significant or tragic event, the person or group addressed remained silent or did not take a stand. Now, according to the speaker, they are speaking out on trivial matters, as indicated by ""silly issues niye dorod dekhaite"" (showing seriousness over minor issues). This implies that the speaker believes that these individuals are only now becoming vocal, but about less important matters, showing a lack of genuine concern for critical issues.

The final part, ""Egula upore uthe niche namar jonno,"" which translates to ""These are to rise up and be brought down for,"" hints that the speaker views these actions as attempts to create drama or gain attention rather than addressing real, pressing concerns. It implies that the motivations behind such behavior are superficial, meant to appear significant or relevant without being so. This kind of commentary points to broader social criticism where the public or certain individuals selectively engage with issues, choosing to act when it's convenient or attention-grabbing, instead of when it truly matters."
"""Lieutenant Tanjim Charowar Nirjan (BA-11453) was killed while conducting a joint operation in Chakaria, Cox's Bazar.

A team of the army went on an operation after finding a terrorist with weapons at around 2:30 am, citing a source. Lt. Tanjim went ahead to negotiate, at one point, when they argued, he stabbed him 3 times in the neck, seriously injuring him. Then he stabbed him once in the left eye, putting the knife right inside the eye. The wound in the neck was very deep, causing profuse bleeding. He died before being brought to CMH.

May Allah grant you heaven.

What do our people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts really want?""",Offensive,"The statement details a tragic incident involving Lieutenant Tanzim Sarwar, who was killed during a joint security operation in the Chakaria region of Cox's Bazar. The narrative describes how the operation, conducted around 2:30 a.m., aimed to apprehend an armed suspect based on an informant's tip. Lieutenant Tanzim attempted to negotiate with the suspect, but an altercation escalated into violence, resulting in multiple fatal knife wounds, including severe injuries to the neck and eye. Despite efforts to treat him at the CMH (Combined Military Hospital), he succumbed to his injuries before arrival. The final lines express sorrow for the loss and raise a rhetorical question about the desires and aspirations of the people of the Chittagong Hill Tracts, hinting at underlying tensions or issues within the region.

"""The movement was successful, but only partially

Grateful: Parbatya Chattogram Chhatra Parishad""",Neutral,"
This statement reflects the partial success of an organized movement led by the Parbatya Chattogram Chhatra Porishod (Hill Tracts Student Council) to remove a controversial figure, barrister Debashish Roy, from the constitutional amendment committee. The activists consider their effort a victory, albeit not a complete one, as the main goal of excluding him was achieved after 24 hours of relentless action. The movement involved extensive lobbying, media coverage, and written advocacy, showcasing the dedication and determination of those involved in pushing for their cause.

The statement conveys that the activists put forth all their resources and energy to ensure the removal of Debashish Roy, who was considered notorious and possibly unsuited for the committee's work. The expression of gratitude at the end, signifies their appreciation for the collective effort that led to this result. It also hints at deeper issues regarding representation and influence in political matters concerning the Chittagong Hill Tracts, underscoring the significance of such movements in advocating for regional interests."
